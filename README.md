A pandas like dataframe in c++

TO DO
------
I want the multimap datatype to store duplicat keys. That can be done.

What datastructure do I want for the data objects. Can I use matrices??

Questions
---------
* Do we need a destructor? If so, the rule of three tells us that we should
    implement a copy constructor and an assignment operator as well
* When is it in general useful to work with references and pointers?
* How can I organize the code well? Can I put have one source file for the
    constructors, one for the opertors, etc?
