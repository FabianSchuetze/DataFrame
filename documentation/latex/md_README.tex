A pandas like dataframe in c++

\subsection*{TO DO }

I want the multimap datatype to store duplicat keys. That can be done.

What datastructure do I want for the data objects. Can I use matrices??

\subsection*{Questions }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Do we need a destructor? If so, the rule of three tells us that we should implement a copy constructor and an assignment operator as well
\item When is it in general useful to work with references and pointers?
\item How can I organize the code well? Can I put have one source file for the constructors, one for the opertors, etc?
